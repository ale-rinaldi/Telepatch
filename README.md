## A fork of the original Telegram client, fine-tuned by its users

[Telegram](http://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. Itâ€™s superfast, simple and free.

We are Ale&Ale'x, we love Telegram and we use it everyday. But we are annoyed of some stupid limitations that the original client has.
So, Telepatch is just... Telegram client, with some improvements to make it better for everyday use. Here are the main goals:
- Multiple expandable notifications showing all the received messages
  (currently, the official client shows only one notification even if you received 100 messages in 30 conversations)
- Customizable vibration pattern
- Customizable LED color
- Whatever you will suggest us

### Status

The GIT fork has just been created, and no releases are currently available.


### ETAs

At the moment, Telepatch is an experiment for us. We don't know when it will be really available. Maybe soon, maybe late, maybe never.
